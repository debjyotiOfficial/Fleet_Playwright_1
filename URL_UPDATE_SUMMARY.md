# URL Update Summary ✅

## Changes Made

The testing URLs have been updated from `index2.php` to `index2_unified.php` as requested by the developer.

### Updated URLs in `fixtures/tlr-config.json`:

1. **fleetDashboard**: `https://www.gpsandfleet3.net/gpsandfleet/client/fleetdemo/maps/index2_unified.php`
2. **fleetDashboard3**: `https://www.gpsandfleet-server1.com/gpsandfleet/client/fleetdemo/maps/index2_unified.php` ⭐
3. **fleetMainDashboard**: `https://www.gpsandfleet3.net/gpsandfleet/client/fleetdemo/maps/index2_unified.php`
4. **fleetDashboardBackup2**: `https://www.tracking.gpsandfleet.io/gpsandfleet/client/shawn.cmstransportation@gmail.com/maps/index2_unified.php`
5. **fleetDashcamDashboard2**: `https://www.gpsandfleet-server1.com/gpsandfleet/client/varsha_dashcamdemo/maps/index2_unified.php`
6. **matrackBackupDashboard**: `https://www.tracking.matrack.io/gpstracking/client/DashcamDemo/maps/index2_unified.php`
7. **ffBackupDashboard**: `https://www.tracking.matrack.io/gpstracking/client/VNMA9275/maps/index2_unified.php`

## Key Target URL

The main URL you specified for testing is now:
**`https://www.gpsandfleet-server1.com/gpsandfleet/client/fleetdemo/maps/index2_unified.php`**

This is available in the config as `config.urls.fleetDashboard3`

## How Tests Use the URLs

### Login Process:
1. Tests use `config.urls.loginPage` for login
2. After login, the application typically redirects to the dashboard
3. Tests can navigate to specific dashboards using:
   - `config.urls.fleetDashboard3` (your new URL)
   - Other dashboard URLs as needed

### Example Usage in Tests:
```javascript
const { test, expect } = require('@playwright/test');
const TestHelpers = require('../utils/test-helpers');

test('example test', async ({ page }) => {
  const helpers = new TestHelpers(page);
  const config = await helpers.loadConfig();
  
  // Login (uses loginPage automatically)
  await helpers.login();
  
  // Navigate to specific dashboard if needed
  await page.goto(config.urls.fleetDashboard3);
  
  // Rest of test...
});
```

## Verification

You can verify the changes by:

1. **Check config file**:
   ```bash
   grep "index2_unified" /d/cypress-to-playwright-converted/fixtures/tlr-config.json
   ```

2. **Run a test**:
   ```bash
   cd /d/cypress-to-playwright-converted
   npm test -- --grep "TS001"
   ```

## No Additional Changes Needed

- ✅ Test files don't need updates (they use config URLs)
- ✅ TestHelpers class doesn't need updates  
- ✅ Playwright config doesn't need updates
- ✅ All URLs are now pointing to `index2_unified.php`

The entire test suite will now run against the new unified URL structure!
